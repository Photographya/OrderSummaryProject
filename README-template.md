## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

It was really cool to prove myself that I can remember the most important properties for backgrounds:

```
body {
    min-width: 375px;
    background-image: url("./images/pattern-background-desktop.svg");
    background-size: cover;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-color: var(--pale-blue);
    font-family: 'Red Hat Display', sans-serif;
}

```


### Continued development

I would like to focus on:

- How to assign better names to classes.
- Reusing and writing better CSS.
- Use more semantic tags than divs.


### Useful resources

- (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6722467/how-to-remove-the-default-link-color-of-the-html-hyperlink-a-tag) -  This helped me to style "a" tag.
